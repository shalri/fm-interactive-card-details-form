- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I used NextJS for this challenge. Since I plan to integrate Frontend Mentor
into my study routine, I might as well play around with NextJS and React
alongside the challenges.

Implementing this challenge with NextJS made it more interesting. It gave me
a broader scope for learning.

This challenge proved to be more challenging than expected. Maintaining `state`
across components required for custom `hooks` and `useContext`.

I also sprinkled some Framer animations for UX/UI enhancements. The parallax
effect for the card and the form validation hopefully will enhance the UX.

This challenge also showed the importance of a `.fig` file. I spent most of
the time pixel-pushing to set the dimensions, spacing, and layout right.
I am proud of the results since I was only eyeballing it.

### Continued development

I look forward to doing more challenges from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io).
I like learning and practicing new concepts.
